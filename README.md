# `bmb` B-Movie Buddy

This is my personal movie database.  As the name indicates, one of the objectives of the project is to discover underappreciated retro scifi and horror movies.

## Repository Organization

The `bmb` repository is organized into the following directories.  Each has its own README that describes its contents in more detail.

* `deprecated`: previous versions of B-Movie Buddy.
* `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebooks. _`notebooks` is currently empty as part of an in-progress version upgrade.  For now, check out `deprecated/v1/notebooks`!_
* `resource`: SQLite `.db` files and for `.py` scripts that I use to run `bmb` code from the terminal.
* `source`: source code.
* `test`: test suite.  I'm trying to use Test-driven Development as much as possible.

The most helpful for orienting yourself to this project will be `notebooks` (*`deprecated/v1/notebooks` until the version upgrade is complete*).  If you are curious about how this is being developed, then `source` and `test` might be interesting as well.
