# `bmb` B-Movie Buddy

This repository contains my __personal movie database__.  As the name implies, one of the objectives is to help me find relatively unknown retro sci-fi and horror movies.

## Repository Organization

The top-level directory contains two folders, both containing a `README` that provides more detailed information about its contents:

1. `notebooks` holds Jupyter notebooks.  There is a Data Engineering Overview, a notebook for data intake, genre analysis, visualizations, _etc._

2. `source` has source code.   I tried to design a clear API, so you should be able to follow the `notebooks` without needing to refer to `source` for any implementation details, but Python programmers will find a few ineresting things here.

Not everything is publicly available; all database files, webscraping code, and API keys have been *gitignore*'d.
