# `deprecated`

This directory contains old versions of B-Movie Buddy.

## Version History

* **Version 1** used three different databases (*Ingestion*, *Processing*, and *Warehouse*).  It had to be completely rewritten in order to allow films to have multiple aliases.
* **Version 2** is the current iteration of `bmb`.
  * `2.0` is the first version of v2 to go live.
    * `FilmDB_v2_alpha.py` is from 2.0 development.
