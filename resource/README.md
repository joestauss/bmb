# `resource`

This directory contains scripts that use `bmb` code.  The _underscored filenames are meant to indicate that the contents, functionality, and existence of these scripts are not guaranteed, similar to the Python private variable syntax.

`resource` is also the location where `bmb` looks for the SQLite `.db` file.  One is not provided in this repository, but you can build one using `_reset_database.py`.
