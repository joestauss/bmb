# `v2` B-Movie Buddy, Version 2

Version 2 is still under development, but all of the code in the `source` directory is working and passes the tests in `test`.  I have been using test-driven development; working tens of thousands of films, the edge-cases have starting to come out and, after building earlier versions of this project, I understand the details of working with film data well enough to write a decent test-suite.

Since I have been using TDD, visit `v2/test/TDD docs` to see the capabilities of B-Movie Buddy Version 2.
