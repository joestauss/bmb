# `notebooks` Jupyter Notebooks

1. **Data Engineering Overview** describes the three main databases and the data flow between them.  Start here.

2. **Web Data Ingestion** notebooks are used to expand the database: **Streaming Availability** tracks which movies are currently able to be streamed; **TMDb Recommendations** finds new films from the connections on TMDb.

3. **Genre Analysis** currently has two steps: **1 - Overview** has basic information about the genres in the Processing Database and the derivation for `ProcessingDB.genre_order`; **2 - Decades** takes a look at the changes in genre-composition over time.

4. **Visualization, Category Association** is the start of what will eventually expand to become a complete _Visualization Appendix_.  For now, the only content is the technique for visualizating categorical association.
